Dear Reader,

My name is Kevin, I'm a software engineer and business owner a few times over. Billiam is my software consulting practice. I service clients outside the tech industry in launching custom software. Not operational, 'help me do my job quicker' software, but rather, new products that extend the existing services of a business. 

Previously, I worked with tech startups: ranging from being a first employee to celebrating an IPO. Hired and managed teams, played founding engineer, backend, frontend, systems, etc.

In 2011, at my first software job, I also got pulled into my first side contract. Moonlighting, as someone called it. 

During the day, I was a small cog in a large platform. At night, I saw what it meant to own an entire product for a hungry business. Over the years, I found that "full picture" view of a platform was not necessarily the typical experience of a professional software engineer. I could tell some colleages had built something from scratch, and some had not.

I saw a similar difference in how people at the "executive" level built products. Investment-funded startup founders approached things very differently than bootstrapped business owners. VC-backed founders optimized for investors and for grand schemes. Not always for customers, or to run a healthy business.

Business owners outside of the tech scene tend to optimize for customers that need to do things now. They don't have existential crises about product-market fit. Just real customer relationships they want to improve. They tend to be  risk-averse and take fewer gambles on tools. As a downside, they aren't always at the frontier of innovation. 

My thesis for Billiam is that if you combine the full-picture product engineer with the seasoned business owner, you can find your own way to doing a "startup" that's healthier, more enjoyable, and less of a gamble than being a founder of a VC-funded startup. 

You take that existing entity that's already doing something, and you extend it with some new tech. 

We do need time to do it. Launching and running a web platform that generates money is not a big boom, one-off project. You can't just hand a check over to a devshop and get a platform three months later. It's more like a long-term landscaping project. There's some big setup moves, some maintenance, some overhauling and some constant improvements. 

I've already started working on this with some pretty outstanding partners. Get in touch if you'd like to learn more.

        To VC-funded founders: we're not looking to partner with tech startups at the moment. Always happy to chat about business and software. I do still have a few people I'm doing a little consulting for in the space, but the full "Build" option of Billiam I'm excited to keep open for the next non-tech business owners. Let me know if you know of anyone good ‚ú® ‚ù§Ô∏è ü•≥
