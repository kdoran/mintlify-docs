description: 'Billiam Tech Stack Recommendations'

I have only done a couple M&A code review projects, but what I've read from engineers that do that type of work is that the common tech stack in "successful" exists is surprisingly boring. Often, not the coolest new tools, but just whatever the team started with at the time (e.g. Angular instead of React, or C# instead of fullstack TypeScript).

However, there are some tools that make things way easier to move quickly. And as iterating is a key ingredient, it's good for us to stick to a fairly proven set of options.



## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"

  View the OpenAPI specification file

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
