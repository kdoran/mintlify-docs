## Positioning Consulting

There are a huge number of consultants that specifically help startups or new products position themselves in a market. Probably, because it's very valuable, and probably because there are tons of startups with unclear positioning. 

Billiam is no such consultancy. However, one of the most common defects I come across in earlier products is an uncertain position. It is unclear who is our end user. 

There's no doubt in my mind that extra time spent on considering the "why" of the product will help us skip unnecessary build cycles.

Who is the end user and what are we helping them do?

## FOMO 

Without a doubt, our greatest enemy in building an extraordinary product is the fear of missing out on some other extraordinary product. It's a sibling enemy we programmers face every day of "maybe this other task is more fun to work on".

Effectively, chosing a market position, end user profile, and Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is a way to say "no" to a lot of other interesting things. But the reason that it's so hard for startups is that they don't know which customer is the best customer for them. 

Ideally, you do. (See Billiam's [Thesis](/etc/thesis).) Your ideal customer of your new web platform should be the customers you're already working with.

## What in the org chart are we doing?

When it comes to how software is going to help your B2B customer, it's helpful to look at an org chart. 

### Example: Hero Teeth Accounting ðŸ¦·

Let's say you're a high-end accounting services firm. You ONLY target dentists, and only those with a certain revenue threshold. Let's take a look at one of your customer's org charts.

  <img src="/images/org-chart.svg" style={{ 
    width: "800px",
    height: "auto",
    borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

Positioning consultants might tell you about how to target a particular bullet in this chart.

For a startup, they may not be sure which role would be best for their service. 

If you've been following along about the thesis of Billiam, you won't be surprised to hear me say that if you're an accounting firm that works with the bookkeepers, you probably are best setup to target the bookkeepers.

Accordingly, if you're an accounting firm that actually works directly with the owner, then let's look at their JD:

- Manages the overall practice
- Provides direct patient care
- Makes hiring decisions

Then your new product might be a tool to help owners consider financial decisions around hiring.

  If you're reading a lot of the caffeine-fueled, VC advice, this is the part where they might look at the job chart, slug another espresso and shout "do ALL the jobs! You're the operating system for dental offices yeeehaw!"
