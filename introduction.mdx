These documents are a series of topics I find myself revisiting during my work on Billiam. Components that are the most important when launching developing a revenue-generating web platform.

If you're unfamiliar with the thesis of Billiam, you can read about it [here](/etc/thesis).

## High level planning

While it's a process step that's never "done", deeply considering the end user and what we're trying to do with the product is a good starting point. 

The positioning of the product in the market, the ideal customer profile (ICP), and a high level "Tech Roadmap" are all related, but they can be workshopped separately.

<Tip>
Heads up: if you're not working with Billiam, another high level document to consider is the [tech plan](/etc/tech-plan), or the <i>who</i> of the project.
